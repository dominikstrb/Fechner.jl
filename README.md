This repository will at some point contain tools for analyzing data from psychophysical (e.g. detection & discrimination) experiments in Julia, including:
- Signal Detection Theory
- Psychometric function fitting
- Bayesian versions of the above with MCMC-based parameter inference

Right now, it provides notebooks that illustrate the link between different concepts in psychophysics - SDT, psychophysical laws, probabilistic models of perception, efficient coding theories etc.
